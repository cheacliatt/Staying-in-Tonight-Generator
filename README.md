## Description

“Staying in Tonight” serves as a tool to help users make a decision about how to spend a night staying at home, by either watching a movie or playing a video game.
When the user opens the page, they are met by a series of selectors indicating various genres. These buttons reflect the genre of the content that will be generated upon clicking the corresponding button.

For example, if the user chooses the genre Comedy, the suggestions generated will be under the genre of Comedy, for both video games and movies. A poster of a random game and movie will appear below the buttons, featuring a brief overview of the media, release date, and a critic’s rating.
